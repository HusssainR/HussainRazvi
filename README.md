Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">  

## 🚀 About Me  
🎓 I'm Hussain Razvi, a **Computer Science & Physics** student at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (James Scholar), graduating in **2026**.  

🔬 My interests lie at the intersection of **quantum computing**, **machine learning**, and **high-performance software engineering**. I've conducted guided quantum algorithm research with **Prof. Eric Chitambar** and completed the **Qiskit Global Summer School** on quantum algorithms, error correction, and superconducting qubits.  

💻 Professionally, I’ve worked as a **Software Engineer Intern** at **Zebra Technologies**, developed blockchain integrations with **Salt & OpenAI**, and contributed to Web3, quantum machine learning, and cross-platform app development projects.  

Outside of coding, you’ll find me **weightlifting**, exploring different cuisines, and enjoying basketball, volleyball, and badminton.
