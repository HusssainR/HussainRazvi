## üöÄ About Me

üéì My name is Hussain Razvi, I'm a student at UIUC Pursuing my Bachelor in **Computer Science & Engineering** and will graduate in mid-2026. 

üë®‚Äçüíª As I've explored my major, I have recently been working with **web3 technologies**. Developments in Solana have led me to join RSOs like Illini blockchain. Creating smart contracts and understanding investment strategies to work with organizations like **DormDao**. In addition, I am also pursuing a career/minor in Physics to join a research lab in **quantum computing** technologies and eventually work in an Acedmia based career. Currently, I am gaining experience in Web3 development, typescript from Blochain testing; Flutter, Firebase, and Dart from **Medlaucnch RSO**; and Data structure manipulations from classes like CS 225. 

üé∏ Outside of school and work, I enjoy weightlifting, exploring different cuisines, and spending time with friends. During my high school days, I competed in men's gymnastics, and I'm still passionate about basketball, volleyball, and badminton.
